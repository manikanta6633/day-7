            <p>Manchurian is a class of Indian Chinese dishes made by roughly chopping and deep-frying ingredients such as chicken, cauliflower (gobi), prawns, fish, mutton, and paneer, and then sautéeing them in a sauce flavored with soy sauce.[2][3] Manchurian is the result of the adaptation of Chinese cooking and seasoning techniques, specifically aimed to suit Indian tastes. It has become a staple of Indian-Chinese cuisine; whilst largely unknown in China, it has become popular in India.
